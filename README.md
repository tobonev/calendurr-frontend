Calendurr is a web-based academic planning tool that is designed to help reduce the stress and challenges of planning courses for students in the UF Computer & Information Science & Engineer (CISE) department. Calendurr aims to provide students with an online academic planning platform that is accessible through any device with access to the internet. 

## Features and How To Use

After registering for Calendurr, users are prompted to the home screen that displays currently saved academic plans, if there are any. On this page students can choose to edit, delete, or create academic plans. To create a new academic plan users can click the Add Schedule button and enter the corresponding information of the name of the plan, their major, their current semester, and their graduation date.

Once created, users will be brought to the edit schedule page where users can drag and drop the courses that are populated for their major. On this page students can add/delete semesters as needed, drag-and-drop courses into semesters, input courses they already have credits for, and save their data. All features are clearly labled on thier designated buttons, and the page even provides a model semester page for students to have an idea on what the final product should look like. From here on out students can choose to save their plan and leave the page.

Now back on the home page, users can choose to edit or delete the schedule by clicking the corresponding buttons on the schedule's display card. In addition, users can choose to create multiple schedules in case they want to create backup plans or alternate routes they make take in their academic career. 

Having users be able to create and save academic schedules to their account's allow for easy access and modificaton of their academic schedules along as they have a device with access to the internet.
